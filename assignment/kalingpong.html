                Located at an altitude of 5,591 feet, Kalimpong is one of the most important heritage 
                
                destinations in West Bengal. Surrounded by the lush greenery of thick forests, beautiful 
                
                mountains, and gorgeous orchids, Kalimpong is a popular hill station in the region. 
                
                Even though it is famous for its natural beauty, not many people know that it has a rich heritage.
                
                Most of the houses and bungalows in Kalimpong take you to the pre-independence era of India.
                
                The influence of Colonial architecture is quite evident throughout the city.

                Places like Dr. Grahamâ€™s House, Crookety House, Tagore Vila, and other sites make this site 
                
                historically enriched. As the Scottish missionaries helped in the construction of schools and churches 
                
                in the area, the entirety of Kalimpong has traces of the colonial era of India. Moreover, the influence of the 
                
                Tibetan community in Kalimpong makes it one of the most ethnically diverse communities in India. There are 
                
                several monasteries located throughout the city that add to its rich heritage.
