    home for the Tagore’s, Shantiniketan soon became one of the most critical educational institutions
    
    in West Bengal and India. The creation of Visva Bharati University made this tiny town the most 
    
    unique universities in the world. Surrounded by golden forests, babbling brooks, and the natural
    
    beauty of rural Bengal, Shantiniketan quite obviously became a popular tourist spot.

    Kaviguru Rabindranath Tagore’s home to the beautiful Chhatimtala in Visvabharati, from Kala Bhawan
    
    to Upasanagriha, Shantiniketan has a lot to offer. If you love to understand the heritage and culture
    
    of a region, Shantiniketan will be perfect for you.
