                Often referred to as the City of Joy, Kolkata is one of the best heritage destinations in West Bengal.
                
                The heritage of this city not only lies in its administrative importance but also, in its rich history. 
                
                As Kolkata was the capital of India for a long time during the pre-independence era, throughout the city
                
                you will see buildings and monuments that contribute to the rich heritage of the city.
                
                Sites like the Howrah Bridge, Victoria Memorial, St. Paul’s Cathedral, Shahid Minar, and other sites will 
                
                remind you of the city’s glorious past. Certain parts of this beautiful and diverse city are so full of 
                
                heritage sites, that your intuitive mind will get satisfied to a large extent by exploring them.

                Even the transportation of Kolkata reeks of immensely diverse culture. Hand-pulled rickshaws or trams make
                
                the region entirely different from the rest of India. Despite being thoroughly cosmopolitan and urban,
                
                Kolkata has managed to keep its cultural heritage intact.
